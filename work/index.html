    <h1>Important notice</h1>

    <p>On Sunday January 9th 2010, a gang of goths were
        spotted stealing several garden gnomes from a shopping
        center in downtown Milwaukee. <strong>They were all wearing green
            jumpsuits and silly hats</strong>, and seemed to be having a whale
        of a time. If anyone has any information about this
        incident, <strong>please contact the police now.</strong></p>
